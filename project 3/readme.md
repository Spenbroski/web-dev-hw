<h2> Idea Phase </h2>

Hmmmm what do I want make my next project like?
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  1 - I think I'll do it on one of my favorite authors/poets Shel Silverstein
<br>
  2 - I'm thinking I do a site on one of my favorite poems by him, Ickle me, Pickle me, Tickle me too
<br>
3 - Here's the poem I'll be citing for my webpage.
<br>
<blockquote>
Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too
Went for a ride in a flying shoe.
<br>
<br>
"Hooray!"
"What fun!"
"It's time we flew!"
Said Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too.
<br>
<br>
Ickle was captain, and Pickle was crew
And Tickle served coffee and mulligan stew
As higher
And higher
And higher they flew,
Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too.
<br>
<br>
Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too,
Over the sun and beyond the blue.
"Hold on!"
"Stay in!"
"I hope we do!"
Cried Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too.
<br>
<br>
Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle too
Never returned to the world they knew,
And nobody
Knows what's
Happened to
Dear Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too.
</blockquote>

<br>
4 - Shel Silverstein has a website but it doesn't really tell that much about him, I think I'll just stick to the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shel_Silverstein) page on him.
<br>
<br>
5 - For the fonts I'm thinking of using Amantic for a nice cursive style, and the Razha for the nice bold effect
<br>
<br>
6 - I don't know what I'm going to do for the color scheme, Shel is a cartoonist who often draws in black and white - but that would be boring as a color scheme right?
<br>
I decided to go with more basic colors for my scheme, now I just gotta figure out how to link them to here.

7 - Shel is a great artists so I have tons of images to choose from, I'm going to use the art he drew for the piece and the cover art for his book in which the poem was featured "Where the Side Walk Ends"

<u><b><center><h1> READ ME MK2 </h2></center></b></u>

The fonts in this project killed me - and same goes with the css. I didn't pick up the new coding language as quickly as I thought, but of well.

When creating my website I had a hard time with the layout of the website. My aside part of my css layout shomehow changed to being below the main.

Well I'm drained so I'm just gonna call it there.

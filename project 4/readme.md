Project 4 - The RWD
</center>
---
The site is going to cantain a definition of what a Responsive web Design is. The site is also going to contain tools that many people utilize when creating a RWD. The site will also feature a section that describes the importance of RWDs
---
In my site i'm going to include maybe one or two images, and I plan on using the social media icons that we used in the last project - just becasue they're super cool.
---
Also I plan on attaching some links to other sites, like tutorials or whatever I can find

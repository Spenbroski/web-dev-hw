TO DO - Make a website with Baking Instuctions

Had a problem with getting the images loading on the live site
FIXED!

Problem with bolding and italicizing headers - still not fixed

When listing items dots appear on the left hand side, not infront of item listed - weird

Figured out how to bold without using the ** it looks like <.b> is going to be an easier solution

Started using <.u> for underlining, I found it easier than using <.ins>

Added some cool Guy Fieri pictures to help give the site some more flare.
